# 不仅要学习语言，还要了解其文化

In high school, I had to learn a foreign language. At the time I thought that I'd get by nicely being good at English so I chose to sleep through three years of French class. A few years later I went to Tunisia on vacation. Arabic is the official language there and, being a former French colony, French is also commonly used. English is only spoken in the touristy areas. Because of my linguistic ignorance, I found myself confined at the poolside reading *Finnegans Wake*, James Joyce's tour de force in form and language. Joyce's playful blend of more than forty languages was a surprising albeit exhausting experience. Realizing how interwoven foreign words and phrases gave the author new ways of expressing himself is something I've kept with me in my programming career.

高中时，我必须学习一门外语。当时我认为只要英语好就可以了，所以我选择在法语课上睡了三年。几年后，我去突尼斯度假。阿拉伯语是那里的官方语言，作为前法国殖民地，法语也很常用。英语只在旅游区使用。由于语言上的无知，我发现自己只能在泳池边阅读《芬尼根的觉醒》（*Finnegans Wake*），这是詹姆斯-乔伊斯（James Joyce）在形式和语言上的力作。乔伊斯将四十多种语言俏皮地融合在一起，虽然令人疲惫，但却是一次令人惊喜的体验。意识到外来词和短语是如何交织在一起，为作者提供了新的表达方式，这让我在编程生涯中受益匪浅。

In their seminal book, *The Pragmatic Programmer*, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas encourage us to learn a new programming language every year. I've tried to live by their advice and throughout the years I've had the experience of programming in many languages. My most important lesson from my polyglot adventures is that it takes more than just learning the syntax to learn a language: You need to understand its culture. You can write Fortran in any language, but to truly learn a language you have to embrace the language. Don't make excuses if your C# code is a long Main method with mostly static helper methods, but learn why classes make sense. Don't shy away if you have a hard time understanding the lambda expressions used in functional languages, force yourself to use them.

安迪-亨特（Andy Hunt）和戴夫-托马斯（Dave Thomas）在他们的开创性著作《实用程序员》（*The Pragmatic Programmer*）中鼓励我们每年学习一门新的编程语言。我一直努力践行他们的建议，这些年来，我有过使用多种语言编程的经历。在我的多语言冒险经历中，我学到的最重要的一课就是，学习一门语言不仅仅需要学习语法： 你需要了解它的文化。你可以用任何语言编写 Fortran，但要真正学会一门语言，你必须接受这门语言。如果你的 C# 代码是一个长长的 Main 方法，其中大部分是静态辅助方法，不要找借口，而是要了解为什么类是有意义的。如果你很难理解函数式语言中使用的 lambda 表达式，也不要退缩，强迫自己使用它们。

Once you've learned the ropes of a new language, you'll be surprised how you'll start using languages you already know in new ways. I learned how to use delegates effectively in C# from programming Ruby, releasing the full potential of .NETs generics gave me ideas on how I could make Java generics more useful, and LINQ made it a breeze to teach myself Scala.

一旦你掌握了一种新语言的使用技巧，你就会惊奇地发现自己会开始以新的方式使用已经掌握的语言。我从 Ruby 编程中学会了如何在 C# 中有效地使用委托，释放 .NET 泛型的全部潜力让我想到了如何让 Java 泛型更有用，而 LINQ 则让我轻而易举地学会了 Scala。

You'll also get a better understanding of design patterns by moving between different languages. C programmers find that C# and Java have commoditized the iterator pattern. In Ruby and other dynamic languages you might still use a visitor, but your implementation won't look like the example from the Gang of Four book.

通过在不同语言间转换，你还能更好地理解设计模式。C 语言程序员发现 C# 和 Java 已经将迭代器模式商品化。在 Ruby 和其他动态语言中，你可能仍然会使用访问者，但你的实现不会像《四人帮》一书中的例子那样。

Some might argue that *Finnegans Wake* is unreadable, while others applaud it for its stylistic beauty. To make the book a less daunting read, single language translations are available. Ironically, the first of these was in French. Code is in many ways similar. If you write *Wakese* code with a little Python, some Java, and a hint of Erlang, your projects will be a mess. If you instead explore new languages to expand your mind and get fresh ideas on how you can solve things in different ways, you will find that the code you write in your trusty old language gets more beautiful for every new language you've learned.

有人可能会说《芬尼根的守灵夜》（*Finnegans Wake* ）难以卒读，但也有人为它的风格之美而喝彩。为了让这本书不那么难读，我们提供了单语译本。具有讽刺意味的是，第一个译本是法文。代码》在许多方面都与之类似。如果你在编写*Wakese*代码时加入一点Python、一点Java和一点Erlang，那么你的项目将会一团糟。如果你探索新的语言来扩展你的思维，并获得如何用不同方法解决事情的新思路，你会发现你用你信任的老语言写的代码会因为你学习的每一种新语言而变得更加优美。
