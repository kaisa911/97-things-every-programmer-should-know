# 多做刻意练习

Deliberate practice is not simply performing a task. If you ask yourself "Why am I performing this task?" and your answer is "To complete the task," then you're not doing deliberate practice.

刻意练习不是简单地执行任务。如果你问自己 "我为什么要执行这项任务？"，而你的答案是 "为了完成任务"，那么你就不是在进行刻意练习。

You do deliberate practice to improve your ability to perform a task. It's about skill and technique. Deliberate practice means repetition. It means performing the task with the aim of increasing your mastery of one or more aspects of the task. It means repeating the repetition. Slowly, over and over again. Until you achieve your desired level of mastery. You do deliberate practice to master the task not to complete the task.

刻意练习是为了提高你完成任务的能力。这关乎技能和技巧。刻意练习意味着重复。这意味着执行任务的目的是提高你对任务的一个或多个方面的掌握。这意味着不断重复。慢慢地，一遍又一遍。直到你达到预期的掌握水平。刻意练习是为了掌握任务，而不是为了完成任务。

The principal aim of paid development is to finish a product whereas the principal aim of deliberate practice is to improve your performance. They are not the same. Ask yourself, how much of your time do you spend developing someone else's product? How much developing yourself?


有偿开发的主要目的是完成一项产品，而刻意练习的主要目的是提高你的表现。两者是不同的。扪心自问，你花了多少时间开发别人的产品？有多少是在开发自己？

How much deliberate practice does it take to acquire expertise?

需要多少刻意练习才能获得专业知识？

- Peter Norvig [writes](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) that "It may be that 10,000 hours [...] is the magic number."
- 彼得-诺维格[写道](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)："也许 10000 个小时[......]就是一个神奇的数字"。

- In *Leading Lean Software Development* Mary Poppendieck notes that "It takes elite performers a minimum of 10,000 hours of deliberate focused practice to become experts."
- 玛丽-波本迪克（Mary Poppendieck）在《引领精益软件开发》（*Leading Lean Software Development）一书中指出："精英人才至少需要 10000 小时的刻意专注练习才能成为专家"。

The expertise arrives gradually over time — not all at once in the 10,000th hour! Nevertheless, 10,000 hours is a lot: about 20 hours per week for 10 years. Given this level of commitment you might be worrying that you're just not expert material. You are. Greatness is largely a matter of conscious choice. *Your choice.* Research over the last two decades has shown the main factor in acquiring expertise is time spent doing deliberate practice. Innate ability is *not* the main factor.

专业技能是随着时间的推移逐渐形成的，而不是在第 10,000 个小时时一下子形成的！尽管如此，10,000 小时也不少：大约每周 20 小时，持续 10 年。考虑到这种投入程度，你可能会担心自己不是成为专家的料。你就是。伟大在很大程度上是一个有意识选择的问题。*过去二十年的研究表明，获得专业技能的主要因素是花时间进行深思熟虑的练习。先天能力并不是*主要的因素。

- Mary: "There is broad consensus among researchers of expert performance that inborn talent does not account for much more than a threshold; you have to have a minimum amount of natural ability to get started in a sport or profession. After that, the people who excel are the ones who work the hardest."

- 玛丽 "研究专家普遍认为，先天天赋所占的比重远远不够；要想在一项运动或一项职业中起步，你必须具备起码的天赋能力。在此之后，最优秀的人就是那些最努力的人"。

There is little point deliberately practicing something you are already an expert at. Deliberate practice means practicing something you are not good at.
刻意练习你已经是专家的东西没有什么意义。刻意练习意味着练习你不擅长的东西。

- Peter: "The key [to developing expertise] is *deliberative* practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes."
- 彼得 "[发展专长]的关键在于*刻意*练习：不是一而再、再而三地做，而是用一项超出你现有能力的任务来挑战自己，尝试它，在做的过程中和做完之后分析自己的表现，并纠正任何错误。"

- Mary: "Deliberate practice does not mean doing what you are good at; it means challenging yourself, doing what you are not good at. So it's not necessarily fun."
- 玛丽 "刻意练习并不意味着做自己擅长的事情，而是意味着挑战自己，做自己不擅长的事情。所以它不一定有趣"。

Deliberate practice is about learning. About learning that changes you; learning that changes your behavior. Good luck.
刻意练习是为了学习。学习能改变你，学习能改变你的行为。祝你好运
