# 不断学习

We live in interesting times. As development gets distributed across the globe, you learn there are lots of people capable of doing your job. You need to keep learning to stay marketable. Otherwise, you'll become a dinosaur, stuck in the same job until, one day, you'll no longer be needed or your job gets outsourced to some cheaper resource.

我们生活在一个有趣的时代。随着开发工作遍布全球，你会发现有很多人都能胜任你的工作。你需要不断学习，以保持市场竞争力。否则，你就会成为恐龙，被困在同样的工作岗位上，直到有一天，你不再被需要，或者你的工作被外包给一些更廉价的资源。

So what do you do about it? Some employers are generous enough to provide training to broaden your skill set. Others may not be able to spare the time or money for any training at all. To play it safe, you need to take responsibility for your own education.

那么你该怎么办呢？有些雇主会慷慨地为你提供培训，以拓展你的技能。而另一些雇主可能根本抽不出时间或金钱来进行任何培训。为了安全起见，您需要对自己的教育负责。

Here's a list of ways to keep you learning. Many of these can be found on the Internet for free:

下面列出了一些让你不断学习的方法。其中很多都可以在互联网上免费找到：

- Read books, magazines, blogs, twitter feeds, and web sites. If you want to go deeper into a subject, consider joining a mailing list or newsgroup.
- 阅读书籍、杂志、博客、微博和网站。如果你想深入了解某个主题，可以考虑加入邮件列表或新闻组。

- If you really want to get immersed in a technology, get hands on — write some code.
- 如果你真的想沉浸于某项技术，那就动手写写代码吧。

- Always try to work with a mentor, as being the top guy can hinder your education. Although you can learn something from anybody, you can learn a whole lot more from someone smarter or more experienced than you. If you can't find a mentor, consider moving on.
- 一定要尽量与导师合作，因为 "唯我独尊 "会阻碍你的学习。虽然你可以从任何人身上学到东西，但你可以从比你更聪明或更有经验的人身上学到更多。如果找不到导师，可以考虑转行。

- Use virtual mentors. Find authors and developers on the web who you really like and read everything they write. Subscribe to their blogs.
- 利用虚拟导师。在网上寻找你非常喜欢的作者和开发者，阅读他们写的所有文章。订阅他们的博客。

- Get to know the frameworks and libraries you use. Knowing how something works makes you know how to use it better. If they're open source, you're really in luck. Use the debugger to step through the code to see what's going on under the hood. You'll get to see code written and reviewed by some really smart people.
- 了解你使用的框架和库。了解了它们的工作原理，你就能更好地使用它们。如果它们是开源的，那你就真的走运了。使用调试器逐步检查代码，看看引擎盖下发生了什么。你会看到一些非常聪明的人编写和审核的代码。

- Whenever you make a mistake, fix a bug, or run into a problem, try to really understand what happened. It's likely that somebody else ran into the same problem and posted it somewhere on the web. Google is really useful here.
- 每当你犯错、修复错误或遇到问题时，请试着真正了解发生了什么。很可能其他人也遇到了同样的问题，并将其发布到了网络上的某个地方。谷歌在这方面非常有用。


- A really good way to learn something is to teach or speak about it. When people are going to listen to you and ask you questions, you'll be highly motivated to learn. Try a lunch-n-learn at work, a user group, or a local conference.
- 学习知识的一个真正好方法是讲授或谈论它。当人们愿意听你讲课并向你提问时，你就会有很强的学习动力。尝试参加公司的午餐学习会、用户组或当地会议。

- Join or start a study group (à la patterns community) or a local user group for a language, technology, or discipline you are interested in.
- 加入或创办一个学习小组（如模式社区），或一个你感兴趣的语言、技术或学科的本地用户小组。

- Go to conferences. And if you can't go, many conferences put their talks online for free.
- 参加会议。如果你不能去，很多会议都会将他们的演讲免费放到网上。

- Long commute? Listen to podcasts.
- 通勤时间长？听播客。

- Ever run a static analysis tool over the code base or look at the warnings in your IDE? Understand what they're reporting and why.
- 有没有在代码库中运行过静态分析工具或查看过集成开发环境中的警告？了解它们报告的内容和原因。

- Follow the advice of [The Pragmatic Programmers](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) and learn a new language every year. At least learn a new technology or tool. Branching out gives you new ideas you can use in your current technology stack.
- 听从 [The Pragmatic Programmers](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) 的建议，每年学习一门新语言。至少学习一种新技术或工具。通过学习，你可以在当前的技术堆栈中找到新的思路。

- Not everything you learn has to be about technology. Learn the domain you're working in so you can better understand the requirements and help solve the business problem. Learning how to be more productive — how to work better — is another good option.
- 并非所有学习的内容都必须与技术有关。学习你工作的领域，这样你才能更好地理解需求，帮助解决业务问题。学习如何提高工作效率--如何更好地工作--也是一个不错的选择。

- Go back to school.
- 重返校园。

It would be nice to have the capability that Neo had in The Matrix, and simply download the information we needed into our brains. But we don't, so it will take a time commitment. You don't have to spend every waking hour learning. A little time, say each week, is better than nothing. There is (or should be) a life outside of work.

如果能像《黑客帝国》中的尼奥那样，把我们需要的信息下载到大脑中就好了。但我们没有这种能力，所以这需要时间投入。你不必把每个醒着的时间都花在学习上。花一点时间，比如每周花一点时间，总比什么都不花强。工作之外还有（或应该有）生活。

Technology changes fast. Don't get left behind.
技术日新月异。不要落在后面。
