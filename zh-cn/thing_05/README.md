# 美在简约

There is one quote that I think is particularly good for all software developers to know and keep close to their hearts:

我认为有一句话特别值得所有软件开发人员了解并牢记在心：

> _风格之美、和谐之美、优雅之美和节奏之美都取决于简洁。._ — 柏拉图

In one sentence I think this sums up the values that we as software developers should aspire to.

我认为这句话概括了我们软件开发人员应该追求的价值观。

There are a number of things we strive for in our code:

在我们的代码中，有许多我们努力追求的东西：

- Readability
- 可读性

- Maintainability
- 可维护性

- Speed of development
- 开发速度

- The elusive quality of beauty
- 难以捉摸的美丽品质

Plato is telling us that the enabling factor for all of these qualities is simplicity.

柏拉图告诉我们，所有这些品质的促成因素都是简单。

What is beautiful code? This is potentially a very subjective question. Perception of beauty depends heavily on individual background, just as much of our perception of anything depends on our background. People educated in the arts have a different perception of (or at least approach to) beauty than people educated in the sciences. Arts majors tend to approach beauty in software by comparing software to works of art, while science majors tend to talk about symmetry and the golden ratio, trying to reduce things to formulae. In my experience, simplicity is the foundation of most of the arguments from both sides.


什么是优美的代码？这可能是一个非常主观的问题。对美的感知在很大程度上取决于个人背景，就像我们对任何事物的感知都取决于我们的背景一样。接受过艺术教育的人与接受过科学教育的人对美的感知（或至少对美的态度）是不同的。艺术专业的人倾向于通过将软件与艺术作品进行比较来理解软件的美，而理科专业的人则倾向于谈论对称性和黄金比例，试图将事物简化为公式。根据我的经验，简洁性是双方大多数论点的基础。

Think about source code that you have studied. If you haven't spent time studying other people's code, stop reading this right now and find some open source code to study. Seriously! I mean it! Go search the web for some code in your language of choice, written by some well-known, acknowledged expert.

想想你学习过的源代码。如果你还没有花时间研究过别人的代码，请马上停止阅读，找一些开放源代码来研究。我是认真的 我是认真的！用你选择的语言在网上搜索一些由知名专家编写的代码。

You're back? Good. Where were we? Ah yes... I have found that code that resonates with me and that I consider beautiful has a number of properties in common. Chief among these is simplicity. I find that no matter how complex the total application or system is, the individual parts have to be kept simple. Simple objects with a single responsibility containing similarly simple, focused methods with descriptive names. Some people think the idea of having short methods of five to ten lines of code is extreme, and some languages make it very hard to do this, but I think that such brevity is a desirable goal nonetheless.

你回来了？回来了？我们说到哪儿了？对了... 我发现，那些能引起我共鸣、让我觉得很美的代码有很多共同点。其中最主要的就是简洁。我发现，无论整个应用程序或系统有多复杂，各个部分都必须保持简单。简单的对象只需承担单一的责任，其中包含的方法也同样简单、重点突出，并具有描述性的名称。有些人认为五到十行代码的简短方法是极端的想法，有些语言也很难做到这一点，但我认为这种简洁性仍然是一个可取的目标。

The bottom line is that beautiful code is simple code. Each individual part is kept simple with simple responsibilities and simple relationships with the other parts of the system. This is the way we can keep our systems maintainable over time, with clean, simple, testable code, keeping the speed of development high throughout the lifetime of the system.
Beauty is born of and found in simplicity.

最重要的是，漂亮的代码就是简单的代码。每个单独的部分都保持简单，其职责简单，与系统其他部分的关系也简单。只有这样，我们才能用干净、简单、可测试的代码保持系统的长期可维护性，从而在系统的整个生命周期内保持较高的开发速度。
美源于简单，也存在于简单之中。
